# Streamlit Video & Text Processor with TTS

A powerful Streamlit application that combines text processing with video editing using Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology. This tool automatically synchronizes video segments with generated audio, applies custom visual effects, and creates a final merged video.

## Features

### 🎤 Voice & Audio Settings
- **14 Different Voices**: Choose from a variety of voice options with different genders and characteristics
- **Recap Styles**: Apply different vocal styles (Normal, Pitch variations, Speed combinations)
- **Emotions**: Select from 11 different emotional tones (Exciting, Calm, Professional, Narrative, Happy, Serious, Whisper, Sad, Sarcastic, Angry, Fear)
- **TTS Engine**: Uses `edge_tts` for high-quality audio generation

### 🎬 Video Editing Features
- **Custom Play Duration**: Adjust play duration from 1-5 seconds
- **Freeze Effects**: Create freeze frames with durations from 1-3 seconds each
- **Zoom Effects**: Apply Zoom In/Out effects during freeze moments for copyright protection
- **Automatic Synchronization**: Video speed automatically adjusts to match TTS audio duration

### 📊 Processing Capabilities
- **Paragraph-Based Splitting**: Automatically splits text into paragraphs
- **Video Segmentation**: Divides video into segments matching paragraph count
- **Parallel Processing**: Processes up to 5-10 segments simultaneously for faster execution
- **Automatic Merging**: Combines all processed segments into a single final video

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- FFmpeg and FFprobe
- Streamlit
- edge_tts
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phyoethura99/streamlit-video-processor.git
cd streamlit-video-processor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Ensure FFmpeg is installed:
```bash
# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg

# On macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# On Windows
# Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
```

## Usage

Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Configure Voice Settings**:
   - Select a voice from the dropdown (14 options available)
   - Choose a recap style (Normal, Pitch variations, Speed combinations)
   - Select an emotion to apply to the voice

2. **Configure Video Editing**:
   - Set play duration (1-5 seconds)
   - Set freeze 1 duration (1-3 seconds) and choose zoom effect
   - Set freeze 2 duration (1-3 seconds) and choose zoom effect

3. **Input Content**:
   - Enter your text in the text area (unlimited words)
   - Upload a video file (MP4, MOV, or AVI format, max 2GB, 1 hour duration)

4. **Process**:
   - Click the "Start Processing" button
   - Wait for processing to complete (progress bar shows status)
   - Download the final video

## How It Works

### Processing Pipeline

1. **Text Analysis**: Splits input text into paragraphs
2. **TTS Generation**: Generates audio for each paragraph using selected voice, style, and emotion
3. **Video Splitting**: Divides the input video into segments matching the number of paragraphs
4. **Speed Adjustment**: Adjusts video segment speed to match the duration of generated audio
5. **Effect Application**: Applies play/freeze/zoom cycles to each segment:
   - Play segment: Normal video playback for specified duration
   - Freeze 1: Freezes frame at play end with optional zoom effect
   - Freeze 2: Freezes frame at freeze1 end with optional zoom effect
6. **Parallel Processing**: Processes multiple segments simultaneously (5-10 workers)
7. **Merging**: Combines all processed segments into a single final video

### Example Cycle (Default Settings)
- **Play**: 3 seconds of normal video
- **Freeze 1**: 1 second freeze with optional zoom
- **Freeze 2**: 1 second freeze with optional zoom
- **Total Cycle**: 5 seconds

This cycle repeats throughout the entire video duration to match the audio length.

## Configuration

### Voice Options
The application includes 14 pre-configured voices with different characteristics for various use cases.

### Recap Styles
- Normal (0% speed, 0Hz pitch)
- ကျားကြီး ၁ (0% speed, 25Hz pitch)
- ကျားကြီး ၂ (0% speed, 35Hz pitch)
- ကျားကြီး ၃ (0% speed, 45Hz pitch)
- နီလာ ချွဲသံ (0% speed, 40Hz pitch)
- ပေါင်းစပ် ၁၅ (15% speed, 15Hz pitch)
- ပေါင်းစပ် ၃၀ (30% speed, 30Hz pitch)
- ပေါင်းစပ် ၅၀ (50% speed, 50Hz pitch)
- အသံသေး ၂၀ (0% speed, 20Hz pitch)
- အသံသေး ၅၀ (0% speed, 50Hz pitch)

### Emotions
Each emotion applies specific speed and pitch adjustments for different tones and moods.

## Limitations

- **Video Format**: Currently supports MP4, MOV, and AVI formats
- **File Size**: Maximum 2GB per video
- **Duration**: Maximum 1 hour per video
- **Text**: Paragraphs are separated by double newlines
- **Processing Time**: Depends on video length, text length, and system resources
- **Audio Quality**: Limited by edge_tts service availability

## Troubleshooting

### FFmpeg Not Found
Ensure FFmpeg is installed and added to your system PATH:
```bash
ffmpeg -version
ffprobe -version
```

### Memory Issues
If processing large videos:
- Reduce the number of parallel workers in the code (change `max_workers` value)
- Process shorter videos or text segments
- Ensure sufficient disk space for temporary files

### Audio Quality Issues
- Try different recap styles and emotions
- Ensure text is properly formatted with clear paragraph breaks
- Check that edge_tts service is accessible
